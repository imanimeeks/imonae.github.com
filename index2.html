We learned how to make graphs. At first it was difficult because you had to make sure you don’t have any typo’s in your code, but once you get the hang of it then it gets easier by the day. It was cool to see the graph pop up and knowing that you accomplished the task at hand. At the end we were able to create more graphs that can pop up like the one you see down below and we did. It was fun and a great experience.
